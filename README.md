# Home Assistant Integration for Thames Water Consumption Data

This Home Assistant integration retrieves water consumption data from Thames Water using their API. It allows you to monitor your water usage directly from your Home Assistant setup without needing additional devices.

You need a Thames Water Smart Meter. The water consumption data provided by this integration is delayed by approximately three days or more. This delay is a characteristic of the Thames Water data system and cannot be altered in this integration.

The integration uses Selenium to log in to the Thames Water website, as it needs to obtain the browser cookies to make the API call. I use the Selenium Addon in Home Assistant.

With these cookies, it then calls the `getSmartWaterMeterConsumptions` API to retrieve the usage data.

The integration was created recently, so it may contain bugs. Proceed with caution!

## Installation

### Installation through HACS

1. Install the custom component using the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS) by adding the Custom Repository:

3. Restart HA
4. Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration and select Thames Water.

## Sensors

The integration will automatically set up the water usage sensor (L).

It updates every day at 12pm.
The first time it runs it will try to get the last 30 days of data.

## Energy Management

The sensor created integrates directly into Home Assistant's [Home Energy Management](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/energy/).
